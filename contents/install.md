# Getting started

To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal. Replace `folder-name-to-create-app` with the desired folder name:

```bash
composer create-project darkenphp/app folder-name-to-create-app "dev-main"
```

After the folder is created, navigate to the project directory you just created and launch the development server with the following command:

```bash
composer dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to access the application:

```bash
http://localhost:8009
```

The development server supports **hot reloading**, automatically compiling your changes as you modify the source files.
